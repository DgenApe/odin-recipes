This is the first project in The Odin Project's Foundation course. At this point, I have spent about 11.5 hours on the entirety of TOP, and about 4.5 hours of that in learning HTML alone. I definitely feel prepared for this project. Preparation level: 9/10

CSS update: Adding the CSS to the project was not super difficult, I felt well prepared withthe exercises given by TOP. What is stumping me is how to push changes to git hub. I have followed mynotes but cannot seem to get my repository updated
